Goal - The goal for this program is to utilize the previous project we created but for this project to create it in an Object Oriented Program. 
We will have the same race with an array of 5 horses and it will print each horses position until a horse wins the race. Our main idea is to use 
two classes one named Horse and another Race in which all of our functions and constructors will be in these files. We will use a random number 
generator in which the user will input a random number that will be used to tell us whether the horses will advance or not.

Input - The inputs for this program will be the integer used to create a random number. This integer will go into a variable that will be used for 
the advances of all the horses. We will be using classes, constructor, methods, functions, and integer arrays. 
   
Output - The programs output will be nearly the same if not the same from our last project. It will prompt the user to enter an integer. Then the 
program will output each horses positions until one of the horses has reached the finish line and then it will state who the winner was for that race

Steps:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
* 1: First For the Horse class we have a private that contains a position variable and for the public contains one constructor named Horse and two 
functions called advance and getposition.
                                                                                                 
* 2: We will create another class called Race where it also contains a private with an array variable and also length which will be our track length. 
Public will have two constructors one called race and the other is also called race but with a parameter. There will be two functions in this class 
called printLane and start.
                                                                                
* 3: Now we will create a Main in which will act as our function that calls the classes and also helps us test them                                                                                                               
* 4: We will need to create our horse class before the main. Within Horse we should know what goes in them from the diagram. In private it will have 
a variable of position. For the public we will use a constructor same name as the class name where it will define the member variable or initiate it.
   
* 5: Now the advance function is just what it states it will advance the positon with a random number generator.
       
* 6: The getposition function does nothing more than just retrieve that positions integer.

* 7: Next we will create another class called Race. This class will also have a 

* 8: Next lets create a Race class. In private it will contain an array where it is declared by Horse(the first class) and we will also have another
variable called length. In public we will have two constructor where one called Race will contain initiated variables and the other Race with a parameter
will have length called a different name.

* 9: There will be two functions that we will use in this class. The first one is a printLane where the same idea applies here in printing the track
but the difference is that we will be getting certain values from the Horse class and use it here.

* 10: The other function will be called start and this will be the main function in which controls the whole class. This functions we will be calling 
the advance function, getfunction, printLane function which will be used to create the same race as we did in our other project.
